# hello-world
My first repository in a personal life-long journey

Hi there! My name is Moses Opere and though I may be a bit
late on joining up, I am still on time. May this be the start
of a new chapter to help grow my skill and career, while having fun 
with coding. At the moment, I am learning how to code in Python.
